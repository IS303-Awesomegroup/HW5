<!--This function accesses the 2 inputs games and teamName and grabs 
their value and stores it to JavaScript variables.
After finishing the logic within the function you 
assign the variable output to the html p tag with the 
id (or name) of outputGames using the innerHTML attribute 
for the html tag.

Here is the logic I want you to write within your JavaScript 
playGame function. You should retrieve the contents of the games 
text box and convert it to an integer since the data is a string. 
You should also retrieve the contents of the teamName text box. 
This has been done for you already in the html file.

I want you to use the number of games from the text box and use a loop 
to play the number of games. Your team that was entered in the text box 
will begin at home. Then, your team will switch between being at home 
and visiting with each iteration of the loop. For example, Game1: home, 
Game2: visiting, Game3: home, etc.

You will still generate random numbers for each of the teams from 0 to 100.
However, whomever is the home team will get a 5 point bonus on their score
within the loop.  If there is a tie, you will play an overtime that 
generates a new random number score up to 15 points. This score will be 
added to the previous score. Do NOT add the extra bonus of 5 points for 
home teams during the overtime portion. If there is another tie, do 
another overtime period generating 2 new random numbers and adding it 
to the total score. Keep doing this until there is no tie. When the game
is over you will store the team name and scores for each team and if 
there was an overtime period. You will show your team name, team score,
your opponent’s score, the number of overtime period(s) – don’t display 
if there wasn’t one, and whether your team won or lost.
